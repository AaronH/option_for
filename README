OptionFor

Option for is an easy way to have rails read a configuration YML file in your Rails 3 config directory. 
Options are first checked for an environment name so you can easily keep track of multiple settings.
Beyond that, the environment variable for $USER is checked


config/option_for.yml
...

hostname:
  production:   myapp.com
  development:  
    default:    localhost:3000
    user1:      myapp.dev
    user2:      myapp.local
    
apikeys:
  googlemaps:
    production: 12345
    test:       24680
    development:
      default:  44444
      user1:    55555
      user2:    88888
  
per_page:
  posts:    10
  comments: 20

...

Then in your code call:

OptionFor.hostname 
OptionFor.apikeys.googlemaps
OptionFor.per_page.posts
