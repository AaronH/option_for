OptionFor

Option for is an easy way to have rails read a configuration YML file in your Rails 3 config directory. 
Options are first checked for an environment name so you can easily keep track of multiple settings.
Beyond that, the environment variable for $USER is checked

Put the option_for directory into vendor/plugins.

Create an option_for.yml in your config directory to hold your settings.

...

hostname:
  production:   myapp.com
  development:  
    default:    localhost:3000
    user1:      myapp.dev
    user2:      myapp.local
    
apikeys:
  googlemaps:
    production: 12345
    test:       24680
    development:
      default:  44444
      user1:    55555
      user2:    88888
  
per_page:
  posts:    10
  comments: 20

...

Then in your code call:

OptionFor.hostname 
OptionFor.apikeys.googlemaps
OptionFor.per_page.posts


If you need to use option_for settings before the Rails environment or plugins are loaded (ala in development.rb)
you will need to add the following to your application.rb before the Application class definition.

require 'yaml'
SETTINGS = YAML.load(File.read(File.expand_path('../option_for.yml', __FILE__)))

Then, in your development.rb you will need to include the items manually.
